# OneNote-Comments
Insert comments in OneNote text with similar visual presentation as in Word or Excel. 
## Ideas
* You can choose fixed side panel (as in Word) or freely moving comment notes (as in Excel).
* Comments are linked to user-selected snippets of text.
* You can comment any text, including other comments.
